### Importance of Database Backups in Disaster Recovery

Database backups are a critical part of any disaster recovery plan. They ensure that a copy of the data is safely stored and can be restored if something goes wrong.

#### **Why Backups Are Important:**
- **Protect Against Data Loss**: In case of hardware failure, software bugs, or accidental deletion.
- **Recover from Cyberattacks**: Such as ransomware or unauthorized access.
- **Ensure Business Continuity**: Helps systems get back online quickly after a disaster.
- **Support Compliance**: Many regulations require regular data backups.

By keeping regular and secure backups, organizations can reduce downtime and avoid permanent data loss during unexpected events.
