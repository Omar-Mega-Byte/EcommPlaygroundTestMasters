### How Schema Validation Helps Maintain Database Consistency

Schema validation ensures that data entered into a database follows predefined rules, such as data types, required fields, and value constraints. This helps maintain consistency by:

- **Preventing invalid data** (e.g., text in a numeric field)
- **Enforcing relationships** (e.g., foreign key constraints)
- **Maintaining structure** across the database

By validating data at the schema level, errors are caught early, reducing the risk of inconsistent or corrupt data.
