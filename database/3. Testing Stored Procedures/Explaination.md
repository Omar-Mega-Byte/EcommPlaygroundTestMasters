### When and Why Stored Procedures Are Used

**Stored procedures** are used when a set of SQL statements needs to be executed repeatedly or involves complex logic. They are stored in the database and can be called by applications when needed.

#### **When to Use:**
- When performing repetitive database operations
- When encapsulating business logic in the database
- When improving performance by reducing multiple query calls

#### **Why They're Useful:**
- **Efficiency**: Reduces network traffic by executing logic on the server
- **Reusability**: Can be reused in multiple applications or parts of a system
- **Security**: Allows controlled access to data through procedure permissions
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage and update logic in one place
