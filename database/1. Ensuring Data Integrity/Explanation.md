### Why Transactional Integrity Is Important in Databases

Transactional integrity ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed fully and correctly. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, preventing partial updates that could lead to data inconsistency.

This is crucial for maintaining:

- **Accuracy** – Data remains correct even in the case of system failures.
- **Consistency** – The database transitions from one valid state to another.
- **Reliability** – Ensures users can trust the system, especially in critical fields like finance or healthcare.

For example, in a banking system, transferring money involves deducting from one account and adding to another. If only one of these actions is completed, it can cause serious errors. Transactional integrity ensures both succeed or both fail together.
