### Importance of Database Backups in Disaster Recovery

Database backups are essential for protecting data against loss due to system failures, cyberattacks, human errors, or natural disasters.

#### **Why Backups Matter:**
- **Data Recovery**: Allows restoration of lost or corrupted data.
- **Business Continuity**: Minimizes downtime and keeps services running.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Protects against unexpected events like ransomware or hardware failure.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps meet legal or industry data protection requirements.

Regular backups ensure that data can be safely restored, making them a key part of any disaster recovery strategy.
