## Key Features

- **UI Testing**: Automated tests for web application interfaces using Selenium WebDriver, including cross-browser and responsive design testing.
  
- **Functional Testing**: Test cases for common workflows such as login, form submissions, and data processing.
  
- **API Testing**: Integration with Postman to validate API endpoints and verify data consistency.

- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing using JMeter or Gatling to analyze response times and scalability.
  
- **Test Reporting**: Detailed HTML test reports generated using TestNG or JUnit, along with logs for debugging.
  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Framework designed to be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines, allowing for continuous automated testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Selenium WebDriver
- Postman (for API testing)
- JMeter/Gatling (for performance testing)

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omar-Mega-Byte/web-automation-framework.git
   cd web-automation-framework
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

3. Configure the environment:
   - Update `config/config.properties` with your browser preferences and API base URLs.

4. Run Tests:
   - **UI & Functional Tests**: Execute `TestNG` tests via Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn test -Dtest=YourTestClass
     ```
   - **API Tests**: Import Postman collections and run via Postman or Newman.
   - **Performance Tests**: Execute JMeter or Gatling scripts as per the configuration.

### Reports:
Test execution reports will be available in the `/reports/` folder, with detailed logs for debugging.
